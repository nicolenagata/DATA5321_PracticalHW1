# Analysis on Youth Marijuana Use

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project explores youth drug use using decision tree models applied to data from the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2020-nsduh-2020-ds0001). The dataset contains information on demographics, household structure, socio-economic status, and drug use behavior among U.S. youth.

**Objective:**  
Investigate factors correlated with youth marijuana use among youths and provide insights that could inform school drug prevention programs.

## ðŸ“Š Problem Framework

We aim to use decision tree models and ensemble methods to understand and predict marijuana usage patterns based on youth demographic and socio-economic factors.

Each model type (classification, multi-class classification, regression) is used appropriately, evaluated thoroughly, and compared with other tree-based approaches (e.g., random forests).
